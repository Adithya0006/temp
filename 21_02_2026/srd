## 2.0 System Identification and Overview

This section provides a high-level description of the **Operator Management & PCB Traceability System**, an industrial application designed to manage assembly line workflows and data integrity.

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The system is an integrated production management platform that bridges the gap between raw manufacturing data (Excel) and real-time shop floor execution. It operates as a web-based dashboard that interfaces with multiple backend servers—a Node.js server for data history and bulk uploads, and a Python server for analytics and operator task management. The system is designed to handle high-volume data (2000+ records) and provides a centralized interface for three distinct organizational levels: Administration, Supervision, and Operations.

### 2.2 Product Functions

The primary functions of the system are categorized by user responsibility:

* **Data Ingestion & Normalization:** Bulk import of production orders from Excel with automatic range expansion (e.g., 100-105) and duplicate prevention.
* **Workflow Configuration:** Creation of "Flow Assignments" to define manufacturing sequences and stage-specific requirements.
* **Traceability & Analytics:** Real-time monitoring of PCB status (Inaction, Assigned, Completed) and stage-wise performance metrics via Recharts visualizations.
* **Task Execution & Logging:** Mobile-responsive operator interfaces for starting tasks, filling stage-specific forms, and linking local machine files automatically.
* **Hold/Inaction Management:** Ability to place PCBs on hold or restore them to the master database for reassignment.

### 2.3 User Characteristics

The system identifies three primary user classes:

* **Administrator:** Technical users responsible for project creation, bulk data imports, and managing global system configurations.
* **Internal Supervisor:** Operational leads who monitor production order distribution, assign workflows, and track team productivity.
* **Operator:** Shop floor personnel who execute assembly tasks, record process data, and upload quality reports.

### 2.4 Constraints

* **Local File Watcher Dependency:** Automated file linking is dependent on a local watcher service running on the operator's machine at a specific URL (`http://localhost:8082`).
* **Browser Memory:** To maintain performance with 2,000+ records, the UI must use virtualization and pagination to avoid browser crashes.
* **Network Latency:** Bulk uploads must be processed in batches of 50 to prevent server-side timeouts on slow networks.
* **Data Format:** The system requires Excel files to follow a loosely standardized header format for auto-detection to function.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Server Availability:** It is assumed that both Node.js and Python backend servers are reachable via the IPs defined in the Redux `configDetails`.
* **Data Integrity:** It is assumed that PCB Serial Numbers are unique identifiers within a specific Project Type (e.g., HEXA vs. OCTA).
* **Local Storage:** The system depends on the browser's `localStorage` to persist user sessions and role permissions during the active session.
* **Third-Party Libraries:** The system depends on MUI (Material UI) for the interface, Recharts for analytics, and XLSX for client-side file parsing.

### 2.6 Apportioning of Requirements

In the event of a phased rollout, the following requirements may be delayed to future versions:

* **Version 1.0 (Core):** Bulk upload, basic flow assignment, and operator task logging.
* **Version 2.0 (Advanced):** Automated correction tickets (Maintenance Mode), advanced user permission management, and cross-department workload balancing.

## 3.0 FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SOFTWARE ITEM

### 3.1 CSCI REQUIREMENTS (Computer Software Configuration Item)

The software is divided into specific configuration items that manage the lifecycle of a PCB from raw data ingestion to final production completion.

#### 3.1.1 Functionality Requirements

* **Data Normalization and Expansion:** The system shall parse Excel spreadsheets and automatically expand serial number ranges (e.g., "100-105") into individual unique records.
* **Mass Upload with Progress Tracking:** The system shall support bulk data commits to the database using a batching strategy (50 records/batch) to maintain server stability during large-scale imports.
* **Dynamic Workflow (Flow) Assignment:** The system shall allow supervisors to define a sequence of manufacturing stages and assign these "flows" to specific PCB batches.
* **Role-Based Task Execution:** The operator interface shall present only the tasks assigned to the current user and allow for "Start" and "Complete" actions to track timing.
* **Automated File Linking:** The software shall interface with a local file watcher to automatically detect and link machine-generated report files based on the PCB serial number.
* **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard:** The system shall visualize production data using line charts for daily trends and horizontal bar charts for stage-wise performance metrics.
* **PCB Traceability and Search:** The system shall provide a searchable database for supervisors to track the current stage, assigned operator, and status of any PCB in real-time.

### 3.2 Physical Characteristics

As a web-based software application, the "physical" characteristics refer to the deployment environment and the hardware interfaces it supports:

* **Client-Side Hardware:** The system is optimized for standard desktop monitors and mobile tablets used on the shop floor.
* **Local File System Interaction:** The software requires a physical connection (via local network) to the storage directories of assembly line machines to facilitate report uploads.
* **Memory Management:** The application uses client-side pagination and "gap previewing" for large datasets to stay within the physical memory limits of standard browser environments.

### 3.3 Environmental Conditions

The system is designed to operate within an industrial manufacturing environment:

* **Network Environment:** The system must operate within a Local Area Network (LAN) where the IP addresses for the Node.js and Python servers are configured and static.
* **Software Dependency Environment:** * **Frontend:** Must be executed in a modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).
* **Backend:** Depends on a dual-server environment: a Node.js runtime for history/uploads and a Python environment for analytics.


* **Local Watcher Service:** A specific environmental requirement is the "Local Watcher" service running at `http://localhost:8082`, which acts as the gateway between the browser and the machine's local storage.
