## 2.0 System Identification and Overview

This section provides a high-level description of the **Operator Management & PCB Traceability System**, an industrial application designed to manage assembly line workflows and data integrity.

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The system is an integrated production management platform that bridges the gap between raw manufacturing data (Excel) and real-time shop floor execution. It operates as a web-based dashboard that interfaces with multiple backend servers—a Node.js server for data history and bulk uploads, and a Python server for analytics and operator task management. The system is designed to handle high-volume data (2000+ records) and provides a centralized interface for three distinct organizational levels: Administration, Supervision, and Operations.

### 2.2 Product Functions

The primary functions of the system are categorized by user responsibility:

* **Data Ingestion & Normalization:** Bulk import of production orders from Excel with automatic range expansion (e.g., 100-105) and duplicate prevention.
* **Workflow Configuration:** Creation of "Flow Assignments" to define manufacturing sequences and stage-specific requirements.
* **Traceability & Analytics:** Real-time monitoring of PCB status (Inaction, Assigned, Completed) and stage-wise performance metrics via Recharts visualizations.
* **Task Execution & Logging:** Mobile-responsive operator interfaces for starting tasks, filling stage-specific forms, and linking local machine files automatically.
* **Hold/Inaction Management:** Ability to place PCBs on hold or restore them to the master database for reassignment.

### 2.3 User Characteristics

The system identifies three primary user classes:

* **Administrator:** Technical users responsible for project creation, bulk data imports, and managing global system configurations.
* **Internal Supervisor:** Operational leads who monitor production order distribution, assign workflows, and track team productivity.
* **Operator:** Shop floor personnel who execute assembly tasks, record process data, and upload quality reports.

### 2.4 Constraints

* **Local File Watcher Dependency:** Automated file linking is dependent on a local watcher service running on the operator's machine at a specific URL (`http://localhost:8082`).
* **Browser Memory:** To maintain performance with 2,000+ records, the UI must use virtualization and pagination to avoid browser crashes.
* **Network Latency:** Bulk uploads must be processed in batches of 50 to prevent server-side timeouts on slow networks.
* **Data Format:** The system requires Excel files to follow a loosely standardized header format for auto-detection to function.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Server Availability:** It is assumed that both Node.js and Python backend servers are reachable via the IPs defined in the Redux `configDetails`.
* **Data Integrity:** It is assumed that PCB Serial Numbers are unique identifiers within a specific Project Type (e.g., HEXA vs. OCTA).
* **Local Storage:** The system depends on the browser's `localStorage` to persist user sessions and role permissions during the active session.
* **Third-Party Libraries:** The system depends on MUI (Material UI) for the interface, Recharts for analytics, and XLSX for client-side file parsing.

### 2.6 Apportioning of Requirements

In the event of a phased rollout, the following requirements may be delayed to future versions:

* **Version 1.0 (Core):** Bulk upload, basic flow assignment, and operator task logging.
* **Version 2.0 (Advanced):** Automated correction tickets (Maintenance Mode), advanced user permission management, and cross-department workload balancing.
